# Harmony-Marketplace
Decentralized Marketplace built on ONE that uses a smart contract to build an effective marketplace where anybody can list a product to sell and any user can buy the listed product

## Deployment
Smart contract is deployed at https://explorer.pops.one/address/0xfa1b64730877925a0ea6f90b8fe2701bca1070d7

## References
This code was modified from https://github.com/dappuniversity/marketplace but that holds just the template of the code and was incomplete.
I added the required functionalities of a marketplace and customized it to deploy on Harmony Testnet.
